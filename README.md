## Description

This final project is our team's submission for AAI-521: Intro to Computer Vision for the University of San Diego's Master of Science in Applied Artifical intelligence program.  Our team experimented with multiple machine learning models and methods, including data augmentation, fine-tuning, and more with a goal of developing an accurate object detection model to detect objects in the fashion industry.  For a real-world application, such a model can provide capabilities to recognize apparal items for purposes related to E-Commerce, inventory management, and customer shopping experience enhancement.
